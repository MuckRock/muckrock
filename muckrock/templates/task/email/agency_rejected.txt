Hi,

You recently submitted a request to "{{ agency.name }}", and we were not able to figure out to which agency you were referring.

Since we weren’t sure where to send the request, we’ve credited it back your account, but we’d still like to help.

There’s a copy of your request draft here if you want to clarify the agency’s name:

{% for foia in foias %}
    * {{ foia.composer.title }} - {{ url }}{% if foia.count == 1%}{% url "foia-draft" idx=foia.composer.pk %}{% else %}{% url "foia-composer-detail" slug=foia.composer.slug idx=foia.composer.pk %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

If you’re filing a request to a local agency, type it in like "Library, Smallville, IL" (Agency Name, City, State Abbreviation); if it’s a state agency just type in "State Police, IL". For federal requests, you can just type the name.

You can also reply to this email with some more information about the agency; we’ll work with you to get it out the door as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
The MuckRock Team

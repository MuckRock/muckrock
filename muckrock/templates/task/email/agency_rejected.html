  <p>Hi,</p>

  <p>You recently submitted a request to "{{ agency.name }}", and we were not able to figure out to which agency you were referring.</p>

  <p>Since we weren’t sure where to send the request, we’ve credited it back your account, but we’d still like to help.</p>

  <p>There’s a copy of your request draft here if you want to clarify the agency’s name:</p>

  <ul>
    {% for foia in foias %}
      <li>
        <a href="{{ url }}{% if foia.count == 1%}{% url "foia-draft" idx=foia.composer.pk %}{% else %}{% url "foia-composer-detail" slug=foia.composer.slug idx=foia.composer.pk %}{% endif %}">
          {{ foia.composer.title }}
        </a>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <p>If you’re filing a request to a local agency, type it in like "Library, Smallville, IL" (Agency Name, City, State Abbreviation); if it’s a state agency just type in "State Police, IL". For federal requests, you can just type the name.

  <p>You can also reply to this email with some more information about the agency; we’ll work with you to get it out the door as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br>
  The MuckRock Team</p>

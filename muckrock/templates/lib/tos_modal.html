  <h1>Terms of Service Agreement</h1>
  <p>
    I've reviewed and understand MuckRock's
    <a href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a> and I understand that certain
    requests are not suitable for MuckRockâ€™s Request service. In
    particular:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Requests are for requesting information, and not making public
      accusations. Our services may not be used as a tool to broadcast
      complaints or engage in harassment or intimidation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Previous requests on the topic of energy-directed weapons,
      touchless torture, gangstalking, and related subjects have proven
      to be disruptive to the site's operations while not producing
      useful responses in the public interest and are not permitted on
      the site.
    </li>
    <li>
      Requests seeking personal information about yourself are not
      suitable for our services. Refer to our
      <a href="https://muckrock.notion.site/Tip-Sheet-Requesting-information-about-yourself-3fb2a338de4a4f7cb4a7d9fcb533bc96">
        tip sheet on requesting information about yourself
      </a> for help with requests of this type.
